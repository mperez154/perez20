/*
Class CarLists (main class)  code it in this order
•	Create an ArrayList of at least six cars, not ordered in any way by price.
•	Create an Iterator and use it to display the entire list of cars.
•	Display the most expensive car in the list. Use the Collections class.
•	Create a linked list from the arraylist.
•	Insert another Car at index 4 in the linked list. This car should now be the cheapest in the list.
•	Sort the linked list in order of increasing price.
•	Create and use a ListIterator to display the linked list in order of increasing price.
•	Remove the first and last Cars from the linked list, displaying them as you do so.
•	Use the ListIterator again to iterate back through the list so cars are now shown in order of decreasing price.
